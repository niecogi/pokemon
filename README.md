## About the project
The project starts from the idea of creating a web page to consult the [PokÃ©mon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon) and in this way learn and practice different skills.

Some of the features that can be found in this frontend project are the following:

- APP with two views: 
  - a list view to display summary information about the Pokemons 
  - a detail view with complete and detailed information about the Pokemons that has been selected.
- Pagination for displaying large numbers of Pokemons
- List and grid mode
- ðŸŒ‘ Dark and ðŸŒžLight mode



## How to run the solution?

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
